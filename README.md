# Origami Simulator
Origami Simulator[Amanda Ghassaei 2017] is a simulator for Origami.
Inputting developments of Origami(.FOLD or .svg), we can get three dimensional shape models and its process animation made from it by bending creases.
Using this simulator, we can make origami works without real paper.
Origami Simulator is an instance method for Origami simulation but it is not for Origami with curved foldings.
In order to simulate Origami with curved foldings, curved foldings need to be approximated to polylines.

My application solve the problem.
